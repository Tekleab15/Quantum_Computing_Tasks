        "Superposition allows a quantum bit (qubit) to exist in a probabilistic combination of the classical states ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ simultaneously. Instead of being definitively 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a state α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩, where α and β are complex amplitudes. This allows qubits to encode and process much more information than classical bits, which can only be in one state at a time.\n",

        " In Task 1, we created a qubit in the ∣+⟩ state, which is an equal superposition of ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ (∣0⟩+∣1⟩)/sqrt(2)). This single qubit effectively explored both classical states at once. When we then entangled it with another qubit, the superposition played a role in creating the correlation. While Task 1's \"forced superposition\" directly led to a specific correlation upon measurement, the underlying principle of a qubit existing in multiple states simultaneously is key. A classical bit cannot represent both 0 and 1 at the same time.\n",

A classical computer would need to evaluate the function n times to check all inputs. A quantum computer, by preparing a superposition of all n inputs, could potentially evaluate the function for all inputs simultaneously. This parallelism is a source of quantum speedup for certain types of problems"

        "Potential Speedup: Entanglement allows for complex correlations between qubits, enabling quantum algorithms to perform tasks that would be intractable for classical computers. For example, in quantum teleportation, entanglement is used to transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another. In quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, entanglement plays a crucial role in achieving exponential speedup over the best classical algorithms. The interconnectedness created by entanglement allows for a more powerful form of parallel processing than what superposition alone can offer."

        "Classical systems operate based on the principles of classical physics, where a bit can only be in a definite state of 0 or 1 at any given time. They cannot simultaneously explore multiple states like a qubit in superposition. Similarly, classical systems cannot exhibit the instantaneous correlations seen in entangled quantum systems. If two classical bits are correlated, their states were determined at some point in the past, and any relationship between them is governed by classical information transfer, which is limited by the speed of light. Classical systems don't have *Superposition* as well as *Entanglement* behaviours"
